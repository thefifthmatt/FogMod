  Comment: Set Firelink ceremony on death, even if it's an ugly transition at the end. Flag 239 is used for the correct ceremony to set. (if off, set ceremony 0. if on, set ceremony 10.)

# 238 is used for the current ceremony. 239 is used for the ceremony to set on death.
# Whenever setting the ceremony without changing respawn point, always change 238 first.
# Whenever changing the respawn point from bonfires, change 239. This is done by ESDs.
# Whenever the ceremony is changed by the game when traveling between bonfires, 238 (current ceremony) may mismatch 239 (ceremony to set on death).
# When looking at a ceremony change, check 238. If it matches, nothing to do. If it mismatches, change both 238 and 239.
# Sometimes, the respawn ceremony will need to be changed even if the ceremony does not change, or even the area. Event 236 below serves this purpose for hardcoded bonfires.

  Comment: Warp to Emma's Cathedral from Aldrich or Yhorm (or outside, if Dancer encountered 13000896 but not defeated 13000890). This is not part of logic so it doesn't need to happen, but keep it in for now anyway, albeit only to inside the cathedral (change location of). Also, Grand Archives Key condition is there in vanilla, although it is removed by item randomizer.

Otherwise, set flag 13004890 and wait for 13005894 (cutscene finished), then activate fog gate and start fight.

  Comment: Progression through the fight, notably reliant on event flag 75100132. This requires 15105805 to *not* be set at the start. Then, if 75100131 is set by entering region 5102700 (in front of the doors and the antechamber) and 15100801 is not set (entered the fog gate), which triggers "turn back" dialogue. Then, requires 15105805 to be set, which triggers until 75100101 is set ("foolishness, the king's degree is no laughing matter").

  Comment: If event flag 15115851 already enabled (set when Shira is triggered), then wait for event flag 15115855 (set after Shira buffs), presumably for multiplayer. Otherwise, wait for 15110801 off, or 15110801 on and also 15110800 on. So invasion can happen either with encountering Gael or with Gael defeated.
